COVID-19 Vaccination Analysis
This project analyzes COVID-19 vaccination data using Python. It provides insights into vaccination trends, country-wise vaccination rates, and overall vaccination progress across the globe. The analysis can help identify regions with high or low vaccination coverage and evaluate the impact of vaccination efforts on public health.

Project Overview
This project uses Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to process and visualize COVID-19 vaccination data. It provides visualizations and summary statistics to help understand the trends and disparities in global vaccination efforts.

Features
Data Cleaning: Preprocessing of raw vaccination data to ensure it’s in a usable format.

Data Visualization: Graphical representation of vaccination trends over time, by country, and other key metrics.

Statistical Analysis: Key statistics such as vaccination rates, country rankings, and population coverage.

Prediction (optional): Forecasting future vaccination trends (if included in your project).

Interactive Plots: Interactive charts for better user engagement (e.g., Plotly for dynamic visualizations).

Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Plotly (optional)

Jupyter Notebooks (optional)

COVID-19 Vaccination Dataset (e.g., from Our World in Data)

Installation
To run this project locally, you’ll need Python and the following libraries. You can install them using pip:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/covid-vaccination-analysis.git
cd covid-vaccination-analysis
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the latest vaccination data (e.g., from Our World in Data) and place it in the data/ folder.

Usage
Once you’ve installed the dependencies and downloaded the data, you can run the analysis. You can start by running the Jupyter Notebook (if applicable):

bash
Copy
jupyter notebook
Open the notebook and follow the instructions in the cells to load the data and visualize vaccination trends. Alternatively, you can run the Python scripts directly from the terminal:

bash
Copy
python analysis_script.py
Data
The COVID-19 vaccination data used in this project comes from Our World in Data. The data includes:

Date of vaccination

Number of people vaccinated

Population of each country

Vaccination rates and progress by country
